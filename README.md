Yet Another Emacs Configuration
===============================

The original intent behind this repo was to be able to have the same Emacs configuration for both my machine at home and at work. But feel free to grab this configuration for yourself. The focus lies on programming stuff.

If there's anything that doesn't work (like hardcoded paths) then please file a bug. If you want to change behaviour feel free to fork this project.
